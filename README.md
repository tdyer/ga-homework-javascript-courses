# Javascript School Homework

## Assignment

We're going to use JavaScript to create a list of `Courses`, `Teachers` and `Students` that are in a school. There's no need to relate the three together right now, but just rather list all the teachers, courses and students to the page. 

Create a constructor method for Courses and Teachers and Students. These should all be 'namespaced' under the `CourseApp` object. 

In the JavaScript, create 4-5 Courses, Teachers and Student objects and store them on the CourseApp. Write a method(s) to write these objects to the page in an organized manner. This should be very similar to what we did in class with the 'fruit' and 'people' examples, except that we're now namespacing them under the CourseApp.

## Bonus

We've given you 3 methods in the bonus section that will run *only* when you click the associated links we've given you in the HTML. These are our first preview of [JavaScript Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event). 

Your bonus task is to make these methods prompt the user for information needed to create additional courses, teachers and students, and then append that information to the associated list. Ignore the `e` variable that's being passed in there for the moment and don't use it. 

We'll be coming back to events on Friday.
